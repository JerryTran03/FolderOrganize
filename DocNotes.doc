Project Title: Automated Google Web Form Creator, and Manager
Overview: The goal of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to create Google Forms programmatically, save these forms in a structured manner within Google Drive, and manage them efficiently with the ability to organize forms into folders and sub-folders.
NOTE: The students do not have to meet all the requirements in order to submit their work, but those who complete more requirements faster will be ranked higher. 
Key Features:
User Authentication: Implement user authentication using OAuth 2.0 to allow users to securely connect their Google accounts to the application.
Form Creation Interface: Develop an intuitive web-based interface for users to create custom Google Forms. The interface should allow users to add various types of form fields (e.g., text fields, multiple-choice questions, checkboxes, etc.), set required fields, add descriptions, and configure other form settings.
Google Drive Integration: Integrate with the Google Drive API to enable the application to create folders and sub-folders for organizing the generated forms. Each form created through the application should be saved in the user's Google Drive account within the specified folder structure (very important).
Form Templates: Provide pre-designed form templates for common use cases (e.g., experiment request form, feedback surveys, experiment result forms, etc.) to help users kickstart their form creation process.
Customization Options: Allow users to customize the appearance of their forms by selecting themes, fonts, and colors.
Form Preview: Enable users to preview the created form before saving it to Google Drive to ensure it meets their requirements.
Form Management Dashboard: Create a dashboard where users can view, edit, duplicate, and delete their saved forms. They should also be able to organize forms into folders and sub-folders directly from the dashboard.
Search Functionality: Implement a search feature that allows users to quickly locate specific forms within their collection, even in large repositories.
Collaboration and Sharing: Enable users to share their forms with collaborators by providing them with view or edit permissions. This feature should leverage Google Drive's sharing capabilities.
Version Control: Implement version control for forms, allowing users to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
Responsive Design: Ensure that the web application is responsive and works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling mechanisms and logging functionalities to track errors and exceptions for debugging purposes.
Documentation and Help Resources: Provide comprehensive documentation and help resources to guide users through the form creation process, integration with Google Drive, and other functionalities of the application.

This structure ensures that forms are saved in folders corresponding to their respective categories and sub-categories. Each form is then placed within the appropriate sub-folder based on the predefined folder structure provided.
